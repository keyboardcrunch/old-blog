          After a recent conversation I realized that some folks have a narrow view of what can be done with Wireguard, and VPN connections in general. Though recently a number of toolsets/frameworks tailored for networking of containers or &amp;ldquo;bolt on zero-trust&amp;rdquo; networking have expanded that perception. My goal with this post is to highlight some software leveraging Wireguard, and to list a few different use-cases and reasons for using Wireguard (over traditional VPN or ZeroTier).

          This post started as a quick note for securing email for unused domains but I decided I could expand upon it a bit more to define terms in a language I believe to be more clear than I&amp;rsquo;ve seen elsewhere, and from the view-point of an administrator or domain owner.
Index  SPF DMARC DKIM Securing Unused Domains Additional Resources  SPF Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a method for defining domains or ips that are allowed to send email for your domain.

          For the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been using either Wordpress or (usually) Ghost for my blogs, and self-hosting them. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a mix of content including home-brewing, fermentation projects, posts describing code projects on my Github, and even rants and reviews. Due to a few failures on my part with backups and migrations, mainly with the images and static content, my blog has ended up missing some content and isn&amp;rsquo;t as clean as I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be.
