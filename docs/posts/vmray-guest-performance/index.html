  content="I recently had the privilege to work with VMRay, a sandbox and malware analysis platform which uses qemu for virtualization, but I quickly noticed that the default settings used for creating virtual machines was grossly underwhelming. All of the VMs were running with a single core, and as far as I know each one of these machines was built without passing any custom qemu arguments during the creation process.
It appears that the default is -smp 1, meaning one vCPU socket/core is assigned."

      <p>I recently had the privilege to work with VMRay, a sandbox and malware analysis platform which uses qemu for virtualization, but I quickly noticed that the default settings used for creating virtual machines was grossly underwhelming. All of the VMs were running with a single core, and as far as I know each one of these machines was built without passing any custom qemu arguments during the creation process.</p>
<p>It appears that the default is <code>-smp 1</code>, meaning one vCPU socket/core is assigned. To view how many CPU cores your host machine has available you can run <code>nproc</code> to get the value. So to have a 4 core system we just need to configure the guest to use the qemu argument <code>-smp 4</code>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re creating a new virtual machine then VMRay provides some configuration options with <code>vm_setup.py</code> most of it is hardware emulation, disk and memory size, with the final option to pass some qemu arguments. If you&rsquo;re trying increase CPU resources on the machines after the fact you follow the below steps, in our example we&rsquo;ll tell VMRay to launch the machine with 2 sockets and 4 cores (note that if you do define socket/cores then you need to use the maxcpus value as well).</p>
<ol>
<li><code>sudo /opt/vmray/bin/vm_setup.py</code></li>
<li>Select 2, VM Operations</li>
<li>Select 8, Change hardware info of existing VM</li>
<li>Select your virtual machine</li>
<li>Select 10, Miscellaneous settings</li>
<li>Select 1, Additional QEMU command line (current value: )</li>
<li>Enter <code>-smp 4,cores=4,sockets=2,threads=1,maxcpus=8</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Your guests will now have much more resources, and the core count will reflect in the guest. Now, this may break some of the virtualization countermeasures but I&rsquo;d rather have a usable analysis machine. You can read more about this setting in the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/qemu-manpage.html">qemu manpage</a>.</p>
